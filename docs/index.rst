Introduction
------------



Available on both Android and iOS platforms, 1Password offers a seamless experience to store, generate, and autofill passwords, along with advanced features like biometric unlocking and security auditing. This guide details everything you need to know about using 1Password on mobile devices.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

1Password mobile apps are officially available on:

- **iOS devices** (iPhone and iPad running iOS 15 or later)
- **Android devices** (Android 8.0 Oreo or later)

These apps support syncing with your 1Password.com account, providing end-to-end encrypted access to your vaults anywhere.

Installing 1Password on Mobile Devices
--------------------------------------

### iOS Installation

1. Open the **App Store** on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Search for **1Password – Password Manager**.
3. Tap **Get** and authenticate if needed.
4. Once installed, open the app to begin setup.

### Android Installation

1. Open the **Google Play Store**.
2. Search for **1Password – Password Manager**.
3. Tap **Install**.
4. After installation, tap **Open** to launch the app.

Initial Setup and Login
-----------------------

When opening 1Password for the first time on your mobile device, you can either:

- **Create a new 1Password account**, or
- **Sign in with an existing account**

### Signing In

To log in to your existing account:

1. Enter your **email address** associated with your 1Password account.
2. Input your **Secret Key**, a unique identifier for your account found in your Emergency Kit.
3. Enter your **Master Password**.
4. If enabled, complete the **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** step.

The Secret Key and Master Password provide two layers of security, while 2FA adds an extra safeguard.

Using 1Password on Mobile
--------------------------

Once logged in, the main screen provides access to:

- **Vaults**: Collections of passwords, notes, credit cards, and other credentials.
- **Favorites**: Your most frequently used logins.
- **Categories**: Quick filters to find logins, secure notes, identities, credit cards, and more.
- **Watchtower**: Security dashboard identifying weak or compromised passwords.

Adding New Items:

- Tap the **"+" button** to add new credentials or secure notes.
- Use the **password generator** to create strong, unique passwords for new accounts.

Autofill and Browser Integration
--------------------------------

### iOS Autofill

1Password integrates with the native iOS AutoFill service, allowing you to log in seamlessly in apps and Safari.

To enable:

1. Go to **Settings > Passwords > AutoFill Passwords**.
2. Turn on **AutoFill Passwords**.
3. Select **1Password** as your default autofill service.
4. Authorize with Face ID, Touch ID, or your Master Password.

When you tap a login field, 1Password suggestions will appear to fill credentials automatically.

### Android Autofill

Android’s Autofill Framework allows 1Password to fill usernames and passwords in apps and browsers.

To enable:

1. Open the **1Password app**.
2. Go to **Settings > Autofill**.
3. Enable **Autofill with 1Password**.
4. Grant accessibility permissions when prompted.

This lets you quickly fill credentials without switching apps.

Biometric Authentication
------------------------

Mobile devices offer biometric authentication that 1Password supports for faster and secure vault access:

- **Face ID** on newer iPhones
- **Touch ID** on older iPhones
- **Fingerprint** sensors on Android devices

Enable biometrics in 1Password’s **Settings > Security** section. You will still be required to enter your Master Password after restarts or sensitive changes.

Watchtower: Your Security Dashboard
-----------------------------------

Watchtower monitors your vault for security risks such as:

- Passwords that have been reused
- Weak passwords
- Passwords involved in known breaches
- Accounts without 2FA enabled

Access Watchtower from the main menu to view alerts and take recommended actions to strengthen your security.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Storage and Generation
------------------------------------------------------

1Password not only stores 2FA secrets but can also generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs).

To add 2FA for a login:

1. Edit or create a login.
2. Tap **Add One-Time Password**.
3. Scan a QR code or enter a manual secret key.
4. 1Password will generate rotating 6-digit codes you can autofill alongside your password.

Synchronization Across Devices
------------------------------

Your 1Password vault syncs in real-time using end-to-end encryption across:

- Mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- Desktop apps (Windows, macOS)
- Web vaults

Changes made on mobile are instantly reflected elsewhere.

Offline Access
--------------

Vault data is securely cached locally on your device for offline use. You can view and use your credentials without an internet connection. Any changes made offline will sync once you reconnect.

Security Best Practices
-----------------------

- Use a **strong Master Password** — 1Password does not store this.
- Enable **biometric unlock** for convenience without compromising security.
- Enable **Two-Factor Authentication** on your 1Password account.
- Regularly review **Watchtower** alerts.
- Avoid logging in from untrusted devices or networks.
- Always update the app and your mobile OS regularly.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
-----------------------------

### Can’t Log In

- Verify email, Secret Key, and Master Password.
- Reset Master Password only via account recovery options.
- Check network connectivity.
- Try signing in via web browser.

### Autofill Not Working

- Ensure autofill service is enabled in system settings.

### Biometric Authentication Fails
